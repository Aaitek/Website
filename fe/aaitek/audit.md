# Comprehensive Website Audit Report

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** The Aaitek website is functional but needs significant optimization to reach "award-winning" quality. While it has good basic structure and Next.js 15 with App Router, it lacks modern performance optimizations, accessibility features, and design polish.

**Key Findings:**
- ❌ No Lighthouse performance baseline (mobile needs testing)
- ❌ Missing Framer Motion for animations
- ❌ No design system or consistent tokens
- ❌ Accessibility issues (missing ARIA, focus management)
- ❌ Unoptimized images and Core Web Vitals
- ❌ No testing infrastructure
- ❌ Bundle size not optimized
- ❌ Missing responsiveness improvements

## Current Technology Stack

### ✅ Strengths
- **Framework:** Next.js 15.2.4 with App Router ✅
- **TypeScript:** Fully typed ✅
- **React:** v19 ✅
- **Tailwind CSS:** v4 with CSS variables ✅
- **SEO:** Good metadata structure ✅
- **Image Optimization:** Using Next/Image ✅

### ❌ Missing Dependencies
- `framer-motion` - For animations
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` / `vitest` - For testing
- `@testing-library/react` - Component testing
- `playwright` - E2E testing
- `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` - Accessibility linting
- `@axe-core/react` - Runtime accessibility testing

## Performance Audit

### Bundle Analysis (Current Estimates)
```
⚠️  JavaScript Bundle: ~180KB (exceeds 150KB target)
⚠️  CSS Bundle: ~45KB (acceptable but can be optimized)
⚠️  Images: Not optimized for WebP/AVIF
❌  No font optimization strategy
❌  No preloading of critical resources
```

### Core Web Vitals (Estimated)
```
❌  LCP: Likely > 3s (large hero images, no optimization)
❌  CLS: Likely > 0.1 (no font loading strategy)
❌  INP: Unknown (needs testing with real interactions)
```

## Priority Issues by Category

### 🔴 Critical (Must Fix)
1. **Performance:** Bundle size reduction & Core Web Vitals
2. **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
3. **Design System:** Consistent tokens and components
4. **Testing:** Basic test coverage and CI

### 🟡 Important (Should Fix)
1. **Animations:** Framer Motion implementation
2. **Responsiveness:** Advanced responsive patterns
